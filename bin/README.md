# Java8

I modified these project and its files to personally study Java 8 From examples made by Joe Jamen from his youtube channel.

For example, to run a program from command line, on the root folder of the project, execute 

javac streams/JavaStreams.java

and then run

java streams/JavaStreams.java

These files are mainly intended to accompany my series of YouTube tutorial videos here, 
https://www.youtube.com/user/joejamesusa
and are mainly intended for educational purposes.
You are invited to subscribe to my video channel, and to download and use any code in
